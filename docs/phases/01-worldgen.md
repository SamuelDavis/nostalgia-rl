# Phase 1: World generation

## Goal

Consistent, seeded world generation for a Minecraft-style overworld with biomes, height, and features, presented roguelike-style so the user can explore it and judge it.

## Decisions

Judged in this phase: feel of the 250 ms turn, readability of height, biome and terrain generation. Art style and mechanics are out of scope.

- **Exploration:** `@` moves one tile per turn with WASD. A tap between turns is buffered and acts once (latest tap wins); a held key repeats every turn. No diagonals.
- **Presentation:** glyphs on a canvas; HTML HUD on top showing position and worldgen debug data for the player's tile; M toggles an HTML map of the field-sampled overview (`src/view/overview.ts`).
- **Height resolution:** 256 levels (was 16). At 16, the steepest natural tile rose under half a level, so cliffs could not exist and height bands were ~60 tiles wide.
- **Cliffs:** a step of more than `MAX_CLIMB` (2) levels is impassable, drawn as a dark line on the tile edge. Rivers, banks and camps are shaped so carving never adds cliffs; natural terrain may. Deep water is impassable; features are not, for now.
- **Height display:** two modes, toggled with H, to compare in playtest. `shade`: ground colour, lightness by height. `tint`: hypsometric colour ramp, ground shown by glyph colour. Both alternate shade every `CONTOUR_INTERVAL` (4) levels.
